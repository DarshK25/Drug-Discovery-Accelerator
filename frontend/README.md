# Drug Discovery Assistant Frontend

This is the frontend for the Drug Discovery Assistant, a tool that uses generative AI to accelerate drug discovery.

## Features

- Generate novel drug candidates based on target properties
- Predict molecular properties for drug candidates
- Search for similar molecules to a query molecule
- Optimize existing molecules to improve properties

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Pages

- **Home**: Landing page with an overview of the application
- **Generate**: Generate novel drug candidates based on target properties
- **Optimize**: Optimize existing molecules to improve properties
- **Search**: Search for similar molecules to a query molecule
- **About**: Information about the application and its technologies

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend library
- Material-UI: UI component library
- Axios: HTTP client
- Chart.js: Data visualization
- React Router: Navigation

## Future Improvements

- User authentication and saved molecules
- More advanced visualization of molecular properties
- Integration with external databases
- Batch processing of molecules
- Collaborative features for research teams
